"""
SQL plugin for :mod:`repoze.what` based on SQLAlchemy.

This is a core plugin that provides ``source adapters`` for groups and
permissions stored in databases.

Below is the "translation" of the terminology used by repoze.what into
databases' terminology:
 * source -> database
 * section -> parent row (in a one-to-many relationship)
 * item -> a child row (in a one-to-many relationship)

In a group source adapter, a ``section`` is a group in the source (a parent
row) and its items are the users that belong to that section (its children
rows). In a permission source adapter, a ``section`` is a permission in the
source (a parent row) and its items are the groups that are granted that
permission (its children rows).

For developers to be able to use the names they want in their model, both the
groups and permissions source adapters use a "translation table" for the
field and table names involved:
  * Group source adapter:
    * "section_name" (default: "group_name"): The name of the table field that
      contains the primary key in the groups table.
    * "sections" (default: "groups"): The groups to which a given user belongs.
    * "item_name" (default: "user_name"): The name of the table field that
      contains the primary key in the users table.
    * "items" (default: "users"): The users that belong to a given group.
  * Permission source adapter:
    * "section_name" (default: "permission_name"): The name of the table field
      that contains the primary key in the permissions table.
    * "sections" (default: "permissions"): The permissions granted to a given
      group.
    * "item_name" (default: "group_name"): The name of the table field that
      contains the primary key in the groups table.
    * "items" (default: "groups"): The groups that are granted a given
      permission.

@attention: These adapters have a serious limitation, since they are based on
    one-to-many relations: If you're using the groups adapter, then your users'
    data must also be handled by SQLAlchemy; likewise, If you're using the
    permissions adapter, then your groups must also be handled by SQLAlchemy.
@attention: When using the SQL group adapter, it will load the authenticated
    used object into repoze.who's identity dict (under the "user" key).
