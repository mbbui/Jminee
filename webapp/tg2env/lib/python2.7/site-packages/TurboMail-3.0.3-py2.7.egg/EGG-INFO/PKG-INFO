Description: TurboMail 3 offers:
        
        * Simplified creation of complex messages, including rich text, attachments, 
          and more.
        * Modular delivery managers including the blocking immediate manager and the
          threaded on demand manager.
        * Modular back-ends ('transports') including SMTP and in-memory (debug)
        * Easier debugging when using the debug back-end in concert with the immediate 
          manager.
        * A plugin architecture with a sample plugin for altered message encoding.
        * Automatic integration into TurboGears 1.x.
        
        Python includes several standard packages for handling e-mail. These libraries 
        are independent of each-other, their documentation is hard-to-follow, and their 
        examples are hardly real-world. TurboMail ties these dispersant elements 
        together with an elegant and extensible API, freeing you (the developer) from 
        drudge-work, strained eyes, and loss of hair, even for the most complicated 
        use-cases.
