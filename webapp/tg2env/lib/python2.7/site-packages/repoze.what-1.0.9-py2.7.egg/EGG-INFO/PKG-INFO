Description: **************************************************
        repoze.what -- Authorization for WSGI applications
        **************************************************
        
        :mod:`repoze.what` is an `authorization framework` for WSGI applications,
        based on :mod:`repoze.who` (which deals with `authentication` and
        `identification`).
        
        On the one hand, it enables an authorization system based on the groups to 
        which the `authenticated or anonymous` user belongs and the permissions 
        granted to such groups by loading these groups and permissions into the 
        request on the way in to the downstream WSGI application.
        
        And on the other hand, it enables you to manage your groups and permissions
        from the application itself or another program, under a backend-independent 
        API. For example, it would be easy for you to switch from one back-end to 
        another, and even use this framework to migrate the data.
        
        This is just the authorization pattern it supports out-of-the-box, but you
        can may it support other authorization patterns with your own
        predicates. It's highly extensible, so it's very unlikely that it will get 
        in your way -- Among other things, you can extend it to check for many 
        conditions (such as checking that the user comes from a given country, based 
        on her IP address, for example).
