ToscaWidgets can inject resources that have been registered for injection in
the current request.

Usually widgets register them when they're displayed and they have instances of
:class:`tw.api.Resource` declared at their :attr:`tw.api.Widget.javascript` or
:attr:`tw.api.Widget.css` attributes.

Resources can also be registered manually from a controller or template by
calling their :meth:`tw.api.Resource.inject` method.

When a page including widgets is rendered, Resources that are registered for
injection arre collected in request-local
storage area (this means any thing stored here is only visible to one single
thread of execution and that its contents are freed when the request is
finished) where they can be rendered and injected in the resulting html.

ToscaWidgets' middleware can take care of injecting them automatically (default)
but they can also be injected explicitly, example::


   >>> from tw.api import JSLink, inject_resources
   >>> JSLink(link="http://example.com").inject()
   >>> html = "<html><head></head><body></body></html>"
   >>> inject_resources(html)
   '<html><head><script type="text/javascript" src="http://example.com"></script></head><body></body></html>'

Once resources have been injected they are popped from request local and
cannot be injected again (in the same request). This is useful in case
:class:`injector_middleware` is stacked so it doesn't inject them again.

Injecting them explicitly is neccesary if the response's body is being cached
before the middleware has a chance to inject them because when the cached
version is served no widgets are being rendered so they will not have a chance
to register their resources.
